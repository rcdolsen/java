# Java Study Repository

This repository contains exercises, notes, and small projects created during my programming studies.  
The code is mainly for **practice and learning purposes**, not for production use.

- Explore libraries, frameworks, and tools
- Improve problem-solving and code readability

## Repository Structure
The repository may include:
- `basic/` → simple exercises and fundamentals
- `oop/` → Object-Oriented Programming practice
- `projects/` → small applications
- `modules/` → experiments with libraries or frameworks
